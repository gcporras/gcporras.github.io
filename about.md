Yes you found me: I'm Gerardo Cepeda Porras.
-------------

I'm a Scrum Master, aspiring Coach with a background in software development and applied research living in
Montreal (Canada). What led me into this Agile thing? The desire to improve, to give back the respect to
people practicing this challenging and exciting profession, and to deliver better products. All this
while having fun at the workplace. What a challenge!

My passions are: Breaking down silos, refactoring management anti-patterns, coaching, team building,
facilitation using innovative technologies (Open Space, Lean Coffee World Cafe, etc.), DevOps,
Continuous Integration and Deployment, Agile methodologies, Web development.

I hold a M.Sc. in Computer Science and a B.Eng. in Computer Systems. I also hold some certifications as
Professional Scrum Master and Open Space Agility Trainer. If you want to know more about my professional path
